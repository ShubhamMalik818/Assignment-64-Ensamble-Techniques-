    "Q1. How does bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- Bagging, short for bootstrap aggregating, is an ensemble learning method that creates multiple models by training each model on a bootstrap \n",

    "     more than one bootstrap sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is a problem that occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well and is not able to generalize to new data. \n",
    "Bagging can help to reduce overfitting by training multiple models on different bootstrap samples of the data. This means that each model will learn \n",
    "slightly different patterns in the data, and the ensemble of models will be less likely to overfit.\n",
